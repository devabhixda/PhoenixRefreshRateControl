# Phoenix RefreshRate Control

Simple app to change Poco X2 Refresh rate (60Hz/90Hz/120Hz) without ADB. Thanks to Max Weinbach for finding this tweak and Rohit Shetty for testing this app.

This app also includes 3 qs tiles for setting 60Hz, 90Hz and 120Hz. Check in your quick settings panel to add them.

Info: This app targets older android sdk in order to set refresh rates without ADB requirement. Ignore the dialog that says "This app was built for an older version of Android...."
